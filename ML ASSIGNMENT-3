The learner has some level of autonomy in this type of learning, as they can choose what to study, when to study it, and at what pace. However, the expert still plays a role by providing the resources and creating the content. The learner may also have the opportunity to ask questions or receive feedback from the expert, although this is typically less direct than in supervised learning. \n",

This type of learning can be highly individualized, as the learner has complete control over what they study, how they study it, and when they study it. Self-education requires a high level of self-motivation, discipline, and curiosity. The learner must be willing to seek out information, critically evaluate sources, and actively engage with the material.

You could use simple linear regression to model the relationship between the size of a house (independent variable) and its price (dependent variable).
