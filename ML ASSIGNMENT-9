    "1) Feature selection: This involves identifying and selecting the most relevant features from the raw data to use in the model. This can be done using various techniques, including statistical tests, correlation analysis, and domain knowledge. The goal is to select a subset of features that are most informative and relevant to the problem at hand while minimizing redundancy and noise.\n",
