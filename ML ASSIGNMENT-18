    "Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two major types of machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data. The input data is paired with its corresponding output or target variable. The algorithm is trained on this data to learn how to predict the output for new inputs. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output variable based on the input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A classic example of supervised learning is a spam filter for emails. The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is labeled as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns to distinguish between the two categories and can predict whether a new email is spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is a type of learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. The algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge of the output or target variable. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover the underlying structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of unsupervised learning is clustering. In clustering, the algorithm groups together similar data points into clusters. For instance, the algorithm can be trained on a dataset of customer purchase histories and group customers based on their purchasing behavior. This can help businesses identify customer segments and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.\n",

    "In summary, supervised learning is used when the output variable is known, while unsupervised learning is used when the output variable is unknown.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Hierarchical clustering: Hierarchical clustering is a method that creates a hierarchy of clusters. It starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then merges them into larger clusters until all the data points belong to a single cluster. It can be further divided into two types: agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then merges them into larger clusters, whereas divisive clustering starts with all the data points in a single cluster and then splits them into smaller clusters. The output of hierarchical clustering is usually presented in a dendrogram, which shows the hierarchical relationship between the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Partitioning clustering: Partitioning clustering is a method that divides the data points into non-overlapping clusters. It assigns each data point to a cluster such that the sum of the distances between the data points and their assigned cluster centroid is minimized. The most popular partitioning clustering algorithm is K-means clustering, which partitions the data points into K clusters based on the mean value of the data points in each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Density-based clustering: Density-based clustering is a method that identifies regions of high density in the data and separates them from regions of low density. It groups together data points that are close to each other and have a high density of other data points around them. The most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), which groups together data points that are close to each other and have a high density of other data points around them."
