Each model can be trained independently, and therefore the training process can be easily parallelized. In distributed training, the training data is partitioned and sent to multiple servers, each responsible for training a subset of the models. Once the individual models are trained, their predictions can be combined on a central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting ensembles, on the other hand, involve training models sequentially, where each subsequent model corrects the errors of the previous model. As a result, distributed training of boosting ensembles is more challenging, as the training of each subsequent model depends on the performance of the previous model.

This aggregated prediction can be compared to the true label of the sample to estimate the performance of the bagging ensemble.\n",

This can be especially useful when the size of the training data is limited, and we want to avoid splitting it into separate training and validation sets. OOB evaluation also allows us to monitor the performance of the ensemble during training, which can help with early stopping or hyperparameter tuning."

    "Extra-Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees) and Random Forests are both ensemble learning methods based on decision trees. However, there are some key differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is in the way that the trees are constructed. In Random Forests, each decision tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the training data and at each node, the best feature is selected among a random subset of features. In contrast, in Extra-Trees, the splitting threshold for each feature is selected randomly within the range of values in the feature's training set, instead of finding the best possible threshold. Additionally, the feature subset used to make splits in each node is chosen randomly and can be different for each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This extra level of randomness in Extra-Trees allows for a higher diversity of trees in the ensemble, which can lead to better performance on noisy or complex datasets. The random selection of splitting thresholds and feature subsets reduces the variance of the individual trees and makes the ensemble more robust to outliers and irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extra randomness in Extra-Trees can also lead to faster training times compared to Random Forests. Since the thresholds are selected randomly, there is no need to compute the optimal threshold for each feature, which can save computation time. However, the exact speedup depends on the size and complexity of the dataset, as well as the implementation of the algorithms."
