    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a way of assigning probabilities to events or hypotheses based on prior knowledge and available evidence. It is named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English statistician and theologian.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Bayesian interpretation, probabilities are subjective degrees of belief, representing the level of confidence one has in a particular statement or hypothesis. In other words, probability is not an objective property of the world, but rather a measure of our uncertainty about it.\n",

    "In Bayesian inference, the probability of an event or hypothesis is updated based on new evidence or data. This is done using Bayes' theorem, which provides a mathematical formula for calculating the probability of a hypothesis given the available evidence. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis is proportional to the product of its prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis."
