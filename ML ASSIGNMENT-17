    "1) Assumption Violations: One of the main challenges of regression analysis is that it relies on certain assumptions about the data. These include linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality, and absence of multicollinearity. Violations of these assumptions can lead to biased or unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients, and can result in incorrect predictions. Therefore, it is important to check these assumptions before conducting a regression analysis and to use diagnostic tools to identify potential issues.\n",

    "2) Causality: Another limitation of regression analysis is that it does not establish causality between the dependent and independent variables. While regression analysis can identify associations between variables, it cannot determine whether one variable causes the other. In other words, regression analysis can tell us whether there is a relationship between variables, but it cannot tell us why that relationship exists. Therefore, it is important to interpret the results of regression analysis with caution and to consider other evidence, such as experimental data or expert knowledge, to establish causal relationships between variables."

    "Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model based on the likelihood function. The likelihood function measures the probability of observing the data given the model parameters. The idea behind MLE is to find the values of the model parameters that maximize the likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand MLE in more detail, let's consider a simple example of tossing a coin. Suppose we want to estimate the probability of getting a head when tossing a coin, based on a sample of observations. We can model this problem using a Bernoulli distribution, where the probability of getting a head is denoted by p. The likelihood function for a sample of n coin tosses is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "L(p) = p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
    "\n",
    "where k is the number of heads in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the maximum likelihood estimate of p, we need to maximize the likelihood function with respect to p. This can be done by taking the derivative of the likelihood function with respect to p, and setting it equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "d/dp L(p) = k*p^(k-1) * (1-p)^(n-k) - (n-k)*p^k * (1-p)^(n-k-1) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for p gives the maximum likelihood estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "p = k/n\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the estimated probability of getting a head is simply the proportion of heads in the sample."
